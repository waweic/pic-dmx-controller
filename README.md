# pic-dmx-controller
A friend of mine did in his Internship at the Institute for Automation some developing.
He used the CCS C-Compiler, so You will have to use the same.
In the main Folder, you will find a .hex and a .dll file. The .hex file should be flashed to a PIC18f4550, the .dll file is a plugin for PCDIMMER. The Electronics are not yet tested on a real DMX-Device, but they ARE tested on a Oscillsocope. 
The electronics should cost about 15â‚¬, but you don't have to use the most expensive parts, e.d the DC/DC Converter and the Octocoupler.
To use the Plugin, You first have to install the Driver, brought in the Driver Folder. 
It is until now just made for Windows and i would really like, if somebody could implement a linux driver.
